# District Level Health Bureau Information Management System Exam Registration Module

This is a simple demo of my internship project. I did this internship in 2011. Here I got permission and uploaded source code for one module of all modules I developed during my internship. This is not exactly the original source code, but works just like original source code. I rewrote, modified and removed some code.
Technologies used includes Java, SQL, HTML, XML, JDBC, Struts 2, JUnit, Selenium, and so on.
